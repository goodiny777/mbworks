I'm Michael. Coding has changed my world. It's not just about apps. Learning to code gave me problem-solving skills and a way to communicate with others on a technical level. I can also develop websites and use my coding skills to get a better job. I learned a basic level of my skills at leZion beRina high scoll in Naale programm and at SoloLearn. Then I improved them to advanced level at HackerU where I'm learnig today with a great teacher Zeev Mindali. You welcome to ask me for anything and I will try to give you the best answer that I can.\")));\n}\n\nexport default Home;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/michaelbabozhko/WebProjects/my-portfolio/src/pages/Home.jsx"],"names":["React","Navbar","Home"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AACA,OAAO,YAAP;AACA,OAAOC,MAAP,MAAmB,0BAAnB;;AAEA,SAASC,IAAT,GAAgB;AACd,SACE;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACE,oBAAC,MAAD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IADF,EAEE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,gBAFF,EAGE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,ijBAHF,CADF,CADF;AAgBD;;AAED,eAAeA,IAAf","sourcesContent":["import React from 'react';\nimport './Home.css';\nimport Navbar from '../components/Navbar.jsx'\n\nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"container\">\n      <div>\n        <Navbar/>\n        <h2>Welcome!</h2>\n        <p>Hey!
