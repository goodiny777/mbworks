I'm Michael. Coding has changed my world. It's not just about apps. Learning to code gave me problem-solving skills and a way to communicate with others on a technical level. I can also develop websites and use my coding skills to get a better job. I learned a basic level of my skills at leZion beRina high scoll in Naale programm and at SoloLearn. Then I improved them to advanced level at HackerU where I'm learnig today with a great teacher Zeev Mindali. You welcome to ask me for anything and I will try to give you the best answer that I can.\")));\n}\n\nexport default Home;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/michaelbabozhko/WebProjects/my-portfolio/src/pages/Home.jsx"],"names":["React","Home"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;;AAEA,SAASC,IAAT,GAAgB;AACd,SACE;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,aADF,EAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,ijBAFJ,CADF,CADF;AAeD;;AAED,eAAeA,IAAf","sourcesContent":["import React from 'react'\n\nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"container\">\n      <div>\n        <h1>Hello</h1>\n          <p>Hey!
